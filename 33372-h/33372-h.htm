<br />
<br />

<h3>CHAP. I.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>A BIRD'S-EYE GLANCE.</h4>
<br />

<p>Among the many beautiful villages near Boston, there is one quite as
beautiful as any, situated but a few miles from that busy metropolis,
called&mdash;but I must not mention its name; that is of very little
consequence. A few rods from the Common, the pride of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>Bostonians,
is the depot of the railroad which passes through this place; and one
has only to jump into the cars, and in less than fifteen minutes he is
there. Uncle Frank has some dear friends in this village, and choice
spirits they are, in his estimation. How much this fact has to do with
his opinion of the beauty of the place, he does not pretend to say. He
has scarcely settled it in his own mind. Nor is it much matter, as the
story about to be related will neither lose nor gain much in its
interest, by the good or ill opinion which the reader may happen to
have of the village itself; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>though I may be pardoned for adding that
I should put rather a low value upon the taste of that man, or woman,
or child, who could visit this part of the country, when Nature has
her best dress on, and not pronounce it one of the most delightful
spots, in his or her opinion, that the sun or moon ever shone upon.</p>

<p>Among my friends in this charming village, is one whom, at present, I
will call Mr. Bissell&mdash;Mr. <i>Samuel Bissell</i>. I will call him so for
the present, I say. His real name is no more like Bissell than yours
is&mdash;no more like Samuel Bissell than it is like John Smith or George
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Jones; but I think he will forgive us, though, for taking such a
liberty with his "good name," should he ever happen to come across
this story, and should it prove to him a sort of looking-glass, in
which he can see his own features.</p>

<p>When he was a lad, about twelve years old, his father, who had been
possessed of a handsome property, failed in business, and as Samuel
says, "became as poor as a church mouse." What would have taken place
if Samuel's father had been successful in his business affairs, so
that it would not have been absolutely necessary for the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>lad to work
for a living, is more than I can say. Probably it is more than anybody
can say. Very likely it would not have been as well for Samuel. It is
a good thing for boys and girls to work. Idleness is the cause of a
great deal of mischief. I really pity the boy whose father brings him
up without giving him a chance to learn some trade or profession. I am
always afraid that, in such cases, the lad will learn a trade "on his
own hook," and one which will give him trouble, if his father or
guardian does not himself see that he gets something better to do.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>As I was saying, it is impossible to tell what would have been the
history of Samuel Bissell, if, by his father's failure in business, he
had not been driven to get a living by his own labor. It is enough for
us to know what his history actually was in the circumstances in which
he was placed when his father, by a sudden change of fortune, became a
poor man.</p>

<p>But I must go back a little in my history. I want you to see and mark
well two or three things, which, though little in themselves, are very
important. Little things, let me tell you, are not to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>be despised,
because they are little. A very small stream of water, which you might
easily wade across, can set the machinery of a whole factory in
motion. Half a dozen marks made with a pen in as many seconds, are
sufficient to send weeping and death into every family in an empire.
So I must go back a few years in the history of our young friend, and
see where he was, what he was, and what sort of a bringing up he had,
before the time of his father's unfortunate failure.</p>

<h4>PEDDLERS AND PEDDLING.</h4>
<br />

<p>I have more than half a mind to give you a rough sketch of the <i>Yankee
Peddler</i>.</p>

<p>"But I know all about this race of men already," perhaps you will say.</p>

<p>Do you? Well, then, consider my sketch as having been made for another
reader, and not for you. The fact is&mdash;for I want to let you into one
of my <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>little secrets, just here, to start with&mdash;the story I am
telling is one about a peddler's boy; and I have got a notion that it
would be a good plan to devote one chapter, before I have any more to
do with the boy himself, to that famous class of men who get their
living principally by peddling small wares about the country.</p>

<p>The peddler&mdash;the genuine Massachusetts or Connecticut peddler&mdash;usually
has a wagon built on purpose for his business, so fitted up that it
will conveniently hold all the articles he has for sale. One who has
ever taken a peep <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>into a peddler's wagon, will not need to be told
that his assortment comprises a great many different articles. Tin
ware occupies a large space. In this department may be found tin
ovens, sauce pans, milk pans, graters, skimmers, and things of that
sort. Then the genuine peddler is always provided with two tin trunks,
I believe&mdash;trunks which are large enough to hold about half a bushel
each. These trunks are stored full of little knick-knacks, "too
numerous to mention," as the dealer in dry goods has it in his
advertisement.</p>

<p>The peddler does not often drive his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>trade in the city. He finds the
country the best place for him. So you generally come across him where
there are not many stores, and where the houses are not very close
together. He stops before the door of a house. I say <i>he</i> stops; but I
ought rather to have said <i>his horse</i>; for the old nag, who, perhaps,
has been in his service for a quarter of a century, stops of her own
accord at the door of every respectable looking house on the route.
She needs no hint from her master in relation to this matter.</p>

<p>Indeed, I once heard of a peddler's <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>mare, who was so well persuaded
that it would be for the interest of her master to stop at the gate of
a certain large and neat-looking farm-house, which gate the peddler
seemed, for once, disposed to pass by, that she actually stopped in
the road, and looked round at the man who had the helm, as if she
would say, "My dear sir, there must be some mistake about this matter.
Are you crazy? Upon my word, this is one of the strangest things that
has ever turned up since we've been driving this peddling business."</p>

<p>We will suppose, now, that the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>faithful horse, guided by something
which, for want of a better name, people generally call <i>instinct</i>,
but which seems to me a good deal like <i>reason</i>, has stopped at the
door of a house. The peddler, taking good care to carry along with him
the tin trunks before mentioned, leaves the wagon, and goes into the
house, the faithful mare, in the meantime, leisurely grazing, if it is
summer, and stamping and kicking, just for exercise, in order to keep
warm, if it is winter.</p>

<p>"Any tin ware to-day, madam?" the peddler asks. Perhaps madam does
want <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>some tin ware, and perhaps she does not. We will suppose, now,
that as far as the department of tin ware is concerned, her wants have
been entirely supplied. Then follows a partial enumeration of the
contents of the two trunks. Did you ever hear a peddler rattle over
the names of these small wares? He does it as rapidly, almost, as a
bobolink goes through the different notes of his song: "Any pins,
needles, sewing silk, twist, buttons, tape, jew's harps, hooks and
eyes, scissors, penknives, pocket books, handkerchiefs, breast pins,
ear rings"&mdash;and so he runs on, hardly waiting for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>the good lady, who
is looking over the articles by this time, to put in a word edgewise.</p>

<p>Peddlers, as a class, are set down as pretty wide awake in driving a
bargain. They have been slandered, I doubt not. A great deal of
unfairness and dishonesty have been charged to them, of which they
never were guilty. Still, I think they are apt to be pretty shrewd and
keen, when they are trading. Sometimes, no doubt, though not always,
they are <i>too</i> shrewd and keen to be strictly honest; for there is a
point where shrewdness and keenness ought to stop.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>When I was a little boy, I lived in Connecticut. My home was in the
very bosom of the country. It was not often that anybody from the busy
world came there; and when one did come, he was sure to make something
of a stir, especially among us little folks. The advent of a tin
peddler's wagon, I recollect, I hailed as a most remarkable event. It
always seemed to me that a peddler's head was as full of knowledge as
it could well hold. Such a budget of news as he always opened! Such
smart things as those which came from his mouth! Such wonderful good
nature <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>as he showed towards the children. Why I don't remember that I
ever heard a peddler speak cross to a boy, though we used always to
tumble over the nameless "notions" in his trunks to our hearts'
content, all the time he stayed in the house. I hardly know which
interested me more, the driving up to our door of a peddler's wagon,
or the entrance into our kitchen of half a dozen Mohegan Indians, with
their squaws and pappooses.</p>

<p>The age of clock peddlers had not come then. Wooden clocks are plenty
as blackberries now; and you can buy <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>one for a song, almost. But
Connecticut clocks were quite unknown in my childhood. Now, I suppose,
the peddlers sell more clocks than tin ovens and sauce pans. But the
peddler of clocks and the peddler of tin ware is, in all important
particulars, one and the same.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of the peddler who sold a load of clocks that would
only keep in order twenty-four hours, and hardly that? It seems that
his clocks were, like Peter Pindar's razors, <i>made to sell</i>, and not
to run. Well, he went a good way off from home, before he offered any
of his wares for sale. He found <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>no trouble in selling the clocks, for
they were wonderfully cheap; and besides, as he took good care to
inform all his customers, each clock was warranted, and on his way
homeward he would call at every house where he sold a clock, when he
should take pleasure in exchanging all the clocks that did not perform
well. Now it turned out that his clocks were not worth a farthing. He
sold out the whole load, though&mdash;every clock but one. Then he turned
about, and commenced his journey homeward, calling upon all his
customers, as he had agreed to do.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>"Well, how did that <i>are</i> clock run neighbor?"</p>

<p>"Run! it didn't run at all. It stopped as still as a gate post before
you had got up Pudding Hill!"</p>

<p>"Did it though, <i>raly</i>?"</p>

<p>"To be sure it did. What on earth did you sell me such a clock for?"</p>

<p>"Well, now, you needn't take on in that style. I'll give you another
clock. I told you I would, when I sold it to you."</p>

<p>So the cunning peddler gives his customer the only clock he has left,
and takes the one he sold him at first, in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>place of it. And that is
the way the fellow managed all the way home.</p>

<p>There are a great many stories told about peddlers, which, I presume,
are not true, and it is sometimes rather difficult to sift the genuine
stuff from the chaff. I really don't know how much to believe of the
anecdotes of Connecticut peddlers of former times. It is a matter of
history, that they sold wooden nutmegs, and horn gun flints, and
white-wood cucumber seeds, and white oak hams. But I should not wonder
if these stories were made out of whole cloth. The truth is, there
have been, first and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>last, a great many false charges made against
"the land of steady habits."</p>

<p>It is a common notion that peddlers are very apt to make dupes of the
ladies. Perhaps they are. But I know of one instance in which a
peddler got nicely come up with by a lady. I don't believe any man
could have done it better. The story is this. A peddler, with a wagon
load of tin ware, drove up to the door of a house around which quite a
number of children were playing. The mistress of the house made her
appearance, and was urged to trade. She had no money, she said. That
was no <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>matter, the peddler replied. He would take anything in
pay&mdash;rags, old clothes, worn out tin, anything. But she hadn't got
<i>anything</i>.</p>

<p>"Well," the peddler continued, "I'll take one of your children."</p>

<p>The lady thought a moment. "Very good," said she, "you may have that
ragged boy yonder for ten dollars, and I'll take the value of him in
tin."</p>

<p>The bargain was struck.</p>

<p>The lady selected the tin ware, and it was carried into the house. The
peddler mounted his seat, with the ragged urchin by his side, and
threatened to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>drive off. "Of course," he thought, "she will not let
me go away with the boy. She will pay me the money, when she sees that
I am <i>raly</i> going." He was mistaken, though. He had reckoned without
his host, this time.</p>

<p>Crack went the whip. "I'm going now," said he. "I'm off in less than
no time."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the good woman; "so I supposed."</p>

<p>He actually started, and went a few rods, slowly, when he stopped,
turned around, and said, "There, now I'm off for <i>sartain</i>."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>"So I heard you say some time ago," said the lady.</p>

<p>"But are you willing I should take off this <i>'ere</i> boy?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the lady. "We keep the <i>town's poor</i> here, and this
is the worst fellow in the lot."</p>

<p>The story is that the peddler, when he found how completely he was
outwitted, gave, in money, about as much as the tin he had parted with
was worth, to get out of the scrape, or in other words, to get clear
of his young pauper.</p>

<h4>THE OTHER SIDE.</h4>
<br />

<p>If I should stop here, in my sketch of the New England peddler, I am
not sure but I should give a false view of that class of people, and I
should be sorry to do that. I must throw some <i>lights</i> into the
picture, in order to make it more perfect and truthful.</p>

<p>I have said before, that the peddler has been charged with a great
many sins <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>which probably he never dreamed of, and certainly never
committed. But a great deal more than this is true of that large class
who make their living by selling merchandise from house to house.
There are hosts of men engaged in this business, who are strictly
honest and fair in all their dealings. They never cheat any one. They
have no disposition to cheat, any more than the merchant who sells his
goods in his own store. Besides, the business, though a great deal has
been done to make it <i>seem</i> anything but respectable, is well enough,
in itself. There is nothing <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>disgraceful about it. It is, or may be,
an honest calling; and it is one of Uncle Frank's doctrines that any
business that is lawful, and honest, and does nobody any harm, ought
to be considered respectable. Why not? Why ought not the boy, even,
who brushes my boots, if he knows as much, and his character is as
good, why ought he not to be respected as much as the one who sets the
types for my daily newspaper? I can't see why, and it would puzzle
anybody to see why, I guess.</p>

<p>I know of peddlers, good men and true, who would as soon part with
one <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>of their fingers as to cheat any of their customers. They want to
make good bargains, when they sell anything. Of course they do. But
they want only that. They would not take advantage of a person's
ignorance of the price of an article, and sell him or her that article
for ten times as much as it is worth, just because they <i>can</i> do it.</p>

<h4>DEACON BISSELL.</h4>
<br />

<p><span class="sc">Deacon Bissell</span>&mdash;Deacon Abijah Bissell, was a peddler of this
sort. I should not wonder if some of my readers had heard of the
deacon. He is in heaven now, I doubt not. But his fame, which, while
he was living, had spread over quite a large section of country in the
commonwealth of Massachusetts, is not dead yet. I dare say scores and
scores <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>of housewives are now on the stage, within a good deal less
than a hundred miles of Boston, who could show you milk pans still on
duty in their cheese room, which came from Deacon Bissell's wagon.</p>

<p>Deacon Abijah Bissell&mdash;<i>Buysell</i> a great many people had it&mdash;occupied
a snug little house, with ever so many flowers in the door yard, and
ever so many tufts of moss on its old shingles. He did not spend more
than half his time at home. The rest was devoted to peddling. No
wandering Arab ever moved oftener from place to place than <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>Deacon
Bissell. Still he had his orbit, and he traveled in it as regularly as
the moon, and Jupiter, and our own planet, travel in their orbits.
Every family he visited knew almost the exact day of his arrival. The
deacon had a great deal of method in everything he did. He was one of
the most punctual and precise men you ever met. An anecdote at this
moment occurs to me, which goes to show what a value he placed upon
punctuality.</p>

<p>Patty Bissell, his eldest daughter, was to ride over to Boston with
the old gentleman. She had been wanting to go to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>the city for a long
time, and she was delighted when her father invited her to go.</p>

<p>"Patty, how long will it take you to get ready?" asked the deacon.</p>

<p>"Half an hour," the girl replied.</p>

<p>"Well, say an hour," said the deacon. "But don't fail to be ready at
the moment. I want you to learn to be punctual, my dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall be ready in an hour, father, and in less time, too."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>The hour passed. The deacon was in his wagon, ready to start. "Well,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>Patty," he shouted, so that his daughter could hear him in the room
where she was busy putting herself in a trim for the city. She was not
quite ready. I think she had forgotten where her gloves were, and was
ransacking every drawer in her bureau for them. The deacon spoke
again.</p>

<p>"In one minute," said Patty.</p>

<p>The deacon waited one minute more, a very long minute, according to
his watch&mdash;and off he started for Boston.</p>

<p>Poor Patty! The disappointment was a sore one for her. But it taught
her a lesson in punctuality which was worth <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>more to her than a
quarter's schooling at the Roundhill Academy.</p>

<p>Mr. Bissell, you will please to take notice, was a <i>real</i> deacon. In
the country, it is a very common thing, I presume you are aware, for
almost all the folks to have some handle or another fixed to their
names; and very often the handle is put on, nobody knows how, or why,
or when, or where. One man is known as a military officer, a
<i>captain</i>, perhaps, or a <i>general</i>. But when you come to inquire into
his history, you find that he never rose to a higher rank than that of
a corporal in the militia, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>possibly not quite so high as that.
Another man is a <i>squire</i>. But how he came to be one, and, indeed,
what is meant by the title in his case, are questions which would
puzzle the wisest heads in the neighborhood. There are, also, in
almost every part of the country, sundry men whom everybody calls
<i>uncle</i>. Each one of them is <i>everybody's</i> uncle in general, and
nobody's uncle in particular. <i>Deacons</i>, too, scores of them, may be
found, who have no other claim to the title than this&mdash;that they are
<i>called</i> so, by nearly all the men, women and children in the parish.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>But Mr. Bissell, as I said before, was a <i>real</i> deacon. The title had
been given to him by the little church in his native parish. And he
was a good man, too. Some people make up their religion into a sort of
a cloak, which they regard as too nice for every day use. They put it
on and wear it every Sunday, and take it off every Monday morning, and
keep it off until Saturday night. You never get a sight of their
religion, when they are about their business. They wear long faces, to
be sure. But a face as long as a broom handle is not worth much to
Uncle Frank, as a sign of a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>man's piety. People may say what they
will about religion&mdash;and in this country, especially, where everybody
can think for himself, and very few get other folks to think for them,
there must be a great many different notions as to what religion
is&mdash;but people may say what they will about it, I think more of
<i>actions</i> than I do of <i>words</i>. I don't care if a man's creed reaches
as far as from the Battery to Grace Church. If he is not fair in his
dealings, and a good neighbor, in every respect, I don't think much of
his religion.</p>

<p>The piety of Deacon Bissell did not <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>all fly off in words, as a glass
of soda water flies off in foam. He was a good man on Saturdays and
Mondays, as well as on Sundays, at home as well as at church, in his
worldly business as well as out of it.</p>

<p>Deacon Bissell had a brother, who did a large business in Boston, and
was supposed to be very rich. Rich people, however, sometimes get a
little cramped in their business, and find it hard to get along.
Deacon Bissell's brother happened, at one time, to need some thousands
of dollars more than he had at command. He knew that the deacon <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>had
saved quite a snug sum from the profits of his small trading, and so
he went to him, and asked him if he would put his name to a note of
some ten or twelve thousand dollars. The deacon had never done
anything of the kind before. But supposing his brother would be able
to pay the note when it was due, and always being anxious to oblige
everybody, when he could, he put his name to the note.</p>

<p>That note ruined Deacon Bissell. His brother could not pay it. He
failed, and his failure swept away nearly every dollar which the
deacon had been laying <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>up for thirty years. This loss tried him very
much. He wept over it&mdash;not because he needed or wanted the lost money
for himself, but because, as he used to remark, it was one of his
darling schemes to give all his children "a good setting out" in the
world. It seemed a terrible loss to him. "If I were a young man," said
he, "I might hope to get up again. But I am old. I am almost worn out.
A few more years, I am afraid, will finish what there is left of me."</p>

<h4>THE YOUNGEST BOY.</h4>
<br />

<p>The deacon had several children. At the time of his failure two or
three were married, and of those that still remained at home, Samuel
was the youngest. It is natural enough for you to suppose that this
Samuel, as I am giving you such a long story about him, was a
remarkable child, a sort of prodigy. But such is not the fact, I
believe. As to his cradle <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>life, I profess not to know much. I have
not much doubt, however, that he was very like other infants&mdash;that he
had his share of little troubles, and cried lustily over them; that he
laughed, and frolicked, and clapped his hands, like most babies; that
he went into raptures over a tin whistle and a rattle box; and that,
in short, he was as wise as most people are, at that interesting age
when the nursery seems to them to comprise the greater portion of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>habitable globe.</p>

<div class="img"><a name="imagep052" id="imagep052"></a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span><br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
<a href="images/imagep052.jpg">
<img border="0" src="images/imagep052.jpg" width="55%" alt="SAMUEL AND THE SCHOOLMASTER." /></a><br />
<p class="cen" style="margin-top: .2em;">SAMUEL AND THE SCHOOLMASTER.<span class="totoi"><a href="#toi">ToList</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>One of the first anecdotes I ever heard about Samuel&mdash;one which,
though it does not make him out a prodigy, shows pretty clearly what
sort of stuff he was made of, as straws show which way the wind
blows&mdash;is something like this: When Samuel was quite a small boy, and
before he had made much progress in his studies at school, there came
to board at his father's, for a few weeks, the teacher of the district
school. This man was fond of children, and took quite a fancy to
little Samuel. "Samuel," said he, one night, when the boy was playing
with a new ball, "did you know the world was round, like your ball?"
No, he had never dreamed of such a thing, he said. He had thought it
was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>as flat as a pancake. "Well, it is round," the teacher said,
"almost as round as a ball or a marble." The little fellow was so much
interested in what the good man told him, that he left his play, and
said he wanted to hear all about the world. So the teacher had to get
his globe, and talk to him about it, until he was hoarse.</p>

<p>I have heard another anecdote about the lad. There was a company of
some half a dozen boys and girls at the deacon's one day, and they
were all as busy as they could be. Shall I tell you what they were
busy about? They were at <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>play. They were playing with all their
might. Among their plays were "blind man's buff," "tag," "puss, puss
in the corner," "hide and seek," "who's got the button?" and I don't
know how many other plays, which almost every child is familiar with.</p>

<p>While they were busy chasing each other round the yard, all of them as
merry as the birds that were having a concert on the branches, over
their heads, a wagon drove up, and Captain Lovechild got out of it,
and went into the house. This gentleman lived in Boston. He was quite
a rich man, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>having made a great deal of money by going to sea. The
captain was a relative of Deacon Bissell, and often came to see him
and his family, taking good care, generally, in his visits, to bring
something with him to please the little folks.</p>

<p>It was almost sunset when the children were called into the house.
Supper was nearly ready, and a very nice supper it was to be, for Mrs.
Bissell always took great pains to make the children happy when they
visited at her house.</p>

<p>Captain Lovechild, as usual, was glad <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>to see the children, and the
children were quite as glad to see him. They all liked him. Why they
liked him, I suppose, not having thought on that subject much, they
would hardly have been able to tell. But I mistrust&mdash;I give it as a
sort of a <i>guess</i>&mdash;that the nice things he was so sure to have ready
for them, when he met them, had a little to do with their affection. I
remember&mdash;if you will allow Uncle Frank to travel out of his road a
few paces&mdash;I remember a lesson which was once beaten into my head by
my little niece. I was going away from home&mdash;to Boston, perhaps&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>when
I called the little girl to me, and said,</p>

<p>"Well, Mary, I'm going away, to be gone, a long, long time."</p>

<p>"O, don't go, uncle," she said; "I don't want you to go away."</p>

<p>"But I must go, dear."</p>

<p>"I shall cry if you do."</p>

<p>"Not a great deal, I guess."</p>

<p>"O, yes, I shall; I shall feel very bad."</p>

<p>"Well, Mary, I can't stay at home; I shall have to go to Boston; and I
presume you will feel sorry to have me go; but suppose I should bring
you <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>something nice when I come back&mdash;a little rabbit, or something of
the kind?"</p>

<p>"O, then you may go, uncle," said Mary, clapping her hands, as a
certain lord of the barn yard does his wings, just before crowing, and
dancing up and down, as if she saw the little white rabbit, with his
long ears and red eyes, actually munching his clover and bean pods on
the carpet.</p>

<p>Ha! ha! ha! The lesson Uncle Frank learned then was, that the love of
children sometimes lies on the surface of the heart, and does not
reach quite to the bottom of it. However, I suppose <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>the same is true
of grown people, too, sometimes, though they are usually more careful
as to what they say, so that they do not let the cat out of the bag.</p>

<p>But I shall be taken up as a <i>vagrant</i>, if I go wandering about in
this style.</p>

<h3>CHAP. VI.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>A NOBLE RESOLUTION.</h4>
<br />

<p>As I said, the children all liked the good old gentleman, for some
reason or other. Now I think of it, I guess the reason of their liking
him might have been hid away in some sly place, as was the reason of
Mr. Somebody for <i>not</i> liking Doctor Fell. This Mr. Somebody used to
say, as you probably have heard,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I do not like you, Doctor Fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reason why I cannot tell."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>If the children had put their thoughts into rhyme, as Mr. Somebody
did, when he gave vent to his feelings in the Doctor Fell affair, no
doubt they would have said this, or something like it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I love you, sir, I love you well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reason why I cannot tell."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When supper was over that evening at Deacon Bissell's, the sun had
been down some time. The stars were beginning to peep out of their
hiding places, and the moon, who had shown her face a little before
the sun took his leave, had now grown bolder, and shone out brightly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>and clearly, as if she were not afraid of anybody, and as if she had
some sort of a notion that she had got to be mistress.</p>

<p>"Well, children," said Captain Lovechild, "what are you going to drive
at next?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bissell remarked that she thought it was almost time for them to
drive towards home, but said that she guessed the captain had
something to show them, and that they might stay just half an hour
longer.</p>

<p>Of course all the boys and girls flocked around the captain; and, sure
enough, he went into another room, and showed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>them one of the most
curious looking instruments, they all thought, that they had ever seen
in their lives.</p>

<p>"Oh, what is that, Captain Lovechild, and what is it for?" So the
children all asked, in nearly the same breath.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>I suppose, indeed, I hope, that you are so much interested in my
story, that you have already had the same questions pass through your
mind; and I will answer your questions as the captain answered those
of his little friends. The instrument which the kind old gentleman had
brought with him all the way from Boston, on purpose to please and
instruct these children, was called a <i>telescope</i>. A telescope is a
long, hollow cylinder, with glasses in it. It is so made that when you
look through it, at anything a great way off, like the moon and the
stars, they appear a great deal larger. It seems to bring them near to
you. You can see them much more distinctly, and as you look at them,
you can find out many wonderful things about them.</p>

<p>As soon as the captain had got the instrument in order, he took it out
into the yard, and pointed one end of the long tube towards the moon.</p>

<div class="img"><a name="imagep065" id="imagep065"></a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span><br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>

<p class="cen" style="margin-top: .2em;">LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE.<span class="totoi"><a href="#toi">ToList</a></span></p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>"Now, then," said he, "just take a peep at the moon. You'll see
something up there, which will make you wonder, or I'm very much
mistaken. One at a time."</p>

<p>And the children, who did not need to be urged much, gathered around
the lower end of the telescope, first one, and then another, until
they had all got a peep at the wonderful things in the moon. I can't
tell you how much they were delighted. It would fill a small volume,
if I should set down all their "ohs," and their "ahs," and everything
else which came rattling out of their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>mouths, while they were looking
through the telescope. But I will tell you what Samuel Bissell said,
though. I will tell you one thing he said, at all events. After he had
looked through the instrument, and had listened to what the old
gentleman said about the moon, and the planets, and the fixed stars,
"I declare," said he, "I don't know anything. <i>I'll be somebody</i>, I'll
know something and do something, if I live."</p>

<p>Samuel, as you will perceive, had his little head so full of the
wonders of the heavens, and had such a strong desire to add to his
stock of knowledge, that he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>used pretty bold language. He did not
say, "I'll <i>try</i> to be somebody," as he might have said, if he had
studied his speech a little. His head was full, so that his words
burst out from his mouth as the water would burst out of a hole in the
dam. Yes, and his <i>heart</i> spoke, too, as well as his <i>head</i>. More
sincere and honest words never dropped from his lips.</p>

<p>A new light dawned on that youth's mind, that evening. From the moment
that he uttered the resolution that he would "be somebody," he labored
to gather a large harvest of knowledge; to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>be something more than a
mere cipher in the world; to act his part well.</p>

<p>"And did he succeed?" you are ready to ask. I should have to get ahead
of my story to answer the question. But one thing I will say here:
that if a boy makes up his mind, deliberately and firmly, that he will
climb up to some high point on the hill of science, and that he will
be respected and honored among his fellows&mdash;if he brings his hands,
and his head, and his heart to the task, and goes ahead, through thick
and thin, not turning out of his path, however he may be tempted to do
so, he is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>almost sure to succeed in reaching what he aims at; that
is, if his life is spared and his health does not give out. I have
great faith in a strong will, a clear head, right principles, a good
stock of patience, and a steady disposition to go ahead. Some boys,
when you talk to them about doing something and being something,
always throw a bucket of cold water over you by saying, "There are so
many difficulties," or, "If I were only in such a boy's place!" Well,
you may always be sure that such cowards will never do anything or be
anything worth mentioning; for it is not very <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>common for people to
accomplish much by <i>accident</i>, and these little chaps, should they
ever succeed at all, would have to blunder into their success.</p>

<p>After hearing this anecdote of Samuel, you will not wonder that, some
years after this resolution was made, when he heard of his father's
loss, he played the part of a hero. I will tell you about that in
another chapter.</p>

<h4>A TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE.</h4>
<br />

<p>"Samuel," said his father, a few days after he learned that he was a
bankrupt, "I don't know what is to become of you. I've lost all the
property I had. I'm not worth a red cent."</p>

<p>"I guess I can take care of myself, father," said the lad. "Don't
worry about that."</p>

<p>"Why, what can you do, Samuel?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>"Not much of anything now, I suppose&mdash;anything which will put dollars
and cents into my pocket&mdash;but I can learn, if I can get a chance."</p>

<p>"And what would you like to do for a living?"</p>

<p>"There are a good many things which I would like to do," said Samuel,
"and may be I shall do them some day; but I've been thinking that just
now, I had better go to work in the factory."</p>

<p>"What! in the cotton factory?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Mr. Mason's."</p>

<p>"But would you like that kind of work?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>"I don't know, sir, I'm sure; I should like to try, at any rate. I
should like to do something."</p>

<p>He did try. That very week, Samuel got a place in Mr. Mason's factory.
His wages were not great, at first. But he earned more than enough to
pay for his board at once, and in a month or two he did much better
than that. Samuel had to work hard, though. The factory bell rang at
day-break, and he was obliged to get up and work an hour or more
before breakfast. All day long, from early morning till evening, and
in the winter season, till nine o'clock at night, he was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>required to
be at work, with the exception of the time&mdash;and that was rather
brief&mdash;allotted to meals. It was a very rare thing that the boys in
the factory had a holiday. Sunday, to be sure&mdash;they had that to
themselves. But most of the boys, it is to be hoped, were too well
brought up and too conscientious to devote any part of that day to
play and amusement.</p>

<p>Once in a great while, however, "like angels' visits, few and far
between," came a holiday. They have a great time, you know, in every
part of the good old commonwealth of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>Massachusetts, when the day of
the annual thanksgiving comes. Very few people, old or young, think of
doing much business on that day.</p>

<h3>CHAP. VIII.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>THANKSGIVING AND TEMPTATION.</h4>
<br />

<p>Well, in process of time, that long looked for festival arrived. No
boy in Meadville had to sleep with an eye open that morning, for fear
he would not hear the first accent of the tongue of the factory bell.
The bell slept; and the boys slept, too, until they were called to
breakfast.</p>

<p>Samuel had not become very intimate <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>with many of the factory boys.
Indeed, among them all, there was only one that he cared a great deal
about associating with; and this one he loved as a brother. The name
of this boy&mdash;or rather, the name by which I prefer to call him in this
narrative&mdash;was Frederick Noble. Frederick and Samuel, when they were
not in the factory, were half their time together. I hardly know what
made them so much attached to each other; though probably one reason
was that the circumstances of the two were somewhat similar.
Frederick's father, as well as Samuel's, had once been a man of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>property, but, like Mr. Bissell, had become comparatively poor.
There's no accounting for likes and dislikes, though. Samuel and
Frederick were fond of each other, and I presume it would have puzzled
either of them to tell the reason for this fondness.</p>

<p>These two boys, according to an arrangement which had been made a long
time beforehand, were companions on thanksgiving day. If I remember
aright, the governor's proclamation for thanksgiving, at the time when
Frederick and Samuel were boys together, used to have these words
tacked to the last end of it: <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>"All servile labor and vain recreation
on said day are by law forbidden." Still, parents and guardians
allowed considerable latitude to the children in their amusements, if
the governor did not. It was pretty generally understood that the
young folks were to have a good time of it, on thanksgiving day.</p>

<p>It very often happens, that when we enjoy ourselves most&mdash;when we come
nearest to being perfectly happy&mdash;we encounter the strongest
temptations, or, what amounts to the same thing, we are induced to
yield to temptation.</p>

<p>Several times during the day, these <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>two boys came very near doing
something which they would have been ashamed of and heartily sorry for
afterwards. They met some boys playing cards for small sums of money,
and were urged to "try their luck." At first, they thought they would,
"just for fun." But they finally concluded that fun of that sort was
rather too dangerous&mdash;that it would cost more than it would come
to&mdash;and so they passed on.</p>

<p>About a hundred rods from the village, in an orchard, our two friends
came across a company of larger boys, who were playing ball. Here
they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>encountered another temptation. The ball-players were treating
themselves to a kind of liquor, which, in those parts, bore the name
of <i>egg-nog</i>. Some of the boys and girls who read this story, or hear
it read, will no doubt laugh at this unmusical and out-of-the-way
name; and I confess the word looked to me so strange and barbarous,
after I had written it down, that I had a great mind to dash my pen
across it, and hunt up some other name for it. However, I concluded I
would go straight to Webster's large dictionary, and see whether he
had taken notice of the word. I <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>made up my mind that, if I found it
in the dictionary, I would hold on to it, and that if it were missing
there, I would let it stay in the society where it was born,
christened and brought up. I went to the dictionary, and there I found
the word, looking, for all the world, as if it were vastly at home.</p>

<p>"Egg-nog," says Doctor Webster, "a drink used in America, consisting
of the yelks of eggs beaten up with sugar, and the whites of eggs
whipped, with the addition of wine or spirits." The addition which
Webster speaks of, and which consisted of <i>spirits</i> when I was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>a boy,
and not of <i>wine</i>, you will please to take notice, was considered a
very important addition, without which the liquor would be worthless.</p>

<p>Well, Samuel and Frederick, though they were strongly urged to "taste
of the nice egg-nog," and though they almost wished that they might so
far gratify their curiosity as to taste of it, succeeded in resisting
the temptation, and letting the stuff alone. Neither of them drank a
drop of it; though I should not wonder if they found it rather hard
work to refuse.</p>

<p>My young friend, perhaps you think <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>these facts are hardly worth
noticing. But I look upon them in a very different light. These boys,
in my opinion, gained great victories that day&mdash;victories quite as
worthy of praise and honor as those of Alexander and C&aelig;sar. They had
the courage to <i>do right</i>, when they were tempted to <i>do wrong</i>. They
did right. And they had their reward, no doubt, when they heard the
voice of conscience in their own bosoms, whispering, "Well done."</p>

<h4>PATRIOTISM AND POWDER.</h4>
<br />

<p>It was more than six months after the thanksgiving festival, before
the factory boys had another holiday. Time, who never stands still a
moment, went on, and by and by, the Fourth of July came round. Samuel
and Frederick were companions on that day, as well as on the preceding
thanksgiving festival. The first thing they did, after they got up in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>the morning&mdash;for they were wakened very early by the ringing of all
the bells in Meadville, not excepting the one on the factory, which
was keyed on a very high note, and was cracked in the bargain, though
it made up in zeal and earnestness what it lacked in depth and
sweetness&mdash;the first thing they did was to climb the hill that
overlooked the village, where the men were firing a salute in honor of
the day. There seems to be something in the smell of gunpowder, and
the sound of a huge-mouthed cannon, which wakes up a good deal of
patriot feeling in the breast of a child.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>How my little heart, when it was not much bigger than a chipping
squirrel's, used to throb with patriotism&mdash;or something else, for I am
not so sure that it was patriotism, after all&mdash;while I heard the rusty
old cannon that did duty at Willow Lane, booming out its sentiments
about matters and things in general, and the declaration of American
independence in particular. As long ago as I can remember, I know the
sound of a drum almost overturned the little sense I had. Oh, what a
quantity of martial spirit was set in motion in my brain, when, as it
sometimes happened, I got a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>chance to beat on that drum myself&mdash;to
beat on it with both hands, "like a trainer." It was one of the
proudest achievements of my childhood, I do believe&mdash;that performance
on the drum&mdash;the real drum, the identical one which the "trainers"
used.</p>

<div class="img"><a name="imagep093" id="imagep093"></a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span><br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>

<p class="cen" style="margin-top: .2em;">THE YOUNG DRUMMER.<span class="totoi"><a href="#toi">ToList</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>It is not quite so with me, now-a-days. You may wonder why. I almost
wonder why myself. But so it is. The deafening roar of cannon, the
racket of a thousand muskets, the clatter of junior drums, and the
thunder of senior ones, have not <i>such</i> a moving effect on me as they
used to have. They <i>move me out <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>of the way</i> now. That is about all.
I suppose, if the truth was known, I dislike <i>war</i> more than I did
when I was a child. War seems a terrible thing to me, whenever I think
of it. I cannot bear the thought that hostile men should meet each
other on the field of battle, and use all the art they are masters of,
in trying to kill each other.</p>

<p>But enough of this. Children, as I was saying, love to hear the noise
of the cannon. It stirs up the embers of their patriotism, or fills
them with some other kind of fire. We will not stop now to inquire
very particularly as to the nature <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>of the blaze. Our two friends felt
as if there was a young Vesuvius burning in their bosoms, as they
listened to the sound of the cannon. Frederick especially, was quite
beside himself. War had completely turned his head. Oh, how he longed
to be a soldier. I am not sure but he almost wished some nation or
other would pick a quarrel with us, so that he might have a chance to
shoulder his musket, and start right off, and fight the battles of his
country. Like a great many other children, he saw only one side of
war, and that was its bright side. He heard no groans <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>from dying men,
no whizzing of cannon balls past his ears. He saw no river of blood
flowing from human veins. He had lost no limb of his own; he was in
danger of losing none. I hardly think he had read the poetical
confessions of a young hero just returned from the wars. Did you ever
read them, my friend? They are worth reading, and I will quote them
for you:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My father was a farmer good,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With corn and beef in plenty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mowed, and hoed, and held the plow<br /></span>

<span class="i2">But off I went, and 'listed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They marched me on through wet and dry,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To tunes more loud than charming,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">I wished that I was mowing.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">They had me in their clutches&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I starved in prison till the peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then hobbled home on crutches."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>This young hero gives the other and darker side of war, you see. There
is reality in what the poor fellow says, if he does tell his story in
rather a humorous vein. I tell you what it is, little friend, there is
nothing good in war. It is a terrible thing; and though I don't
pretend to say that it is never necessary, I consider it one of the
worst curses with which a nation is ever visited&mdash;worse than
pestilence, worse than famine. That is the reason why I do not quite
like to see boys so fond of war, and so full of the war spirit.</p>

<p>But we must proceed with the story.</p>

<h4>THE GLASS OF GIN.</h4>
<br />

<p>Soon after breakfast was over that morning, Samuel and his companion
strolled out into the village. None but those who are kept constantly
at work in a close room, almost every day in the year, except Sunday,
can imagine with what light hearts these two boys walked the streets
of that factory village, on the morning of that memorable holiday. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>say memorable. It proved to be a day which neither of these boys could
well forget.</p>

<p>As they passed along through the village in the course of the
forenoon, they saw a great many sights, which to their young eyes,
were worth going a great way to see. There were tents erected on the
square in front of the meeting house&mdash;tents in which there were scores
of eatable and drinkable things to sell. In one of these tents, there
was a boy, who seemed very much at home, dealing out candies, and
filberts, and raisins, and gingerbread, and liquors of different
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>kinds. There were a dozen different bottles and decanters in his tent,
each with some sort of liquor in it.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" said he, as soon as the two friends came up to the tent;
"why, Fred, is that you?" And he wrung Frederick's hand much as a
farmer is accustomed to wring the necks of fat chickens, a day or two
before Christmas or Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>It turned out that the youth who was so glad to see Frederick, was
Peter Pippin, a son of the butcher in the place where Frederick's
father lived. Peter was a rude, untutored boy, rough as a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>nutmeg
grater, or a chestnut bur. He and Frederick had been to school
together; and though they had never been very intimate, because their
tastes were so different, they had been sufficiently acquainted to be
really glad to see each other again, after a separation of more than a
year.</p>

<p>"Bless me!" said Peter&mdash;<i>Pete</i> he was always called at school, but we
will give him all that belongs to him, for that is nothing to boast
of&mdash;"bless me! how you have grown, Fred. 'Pon my soul, I'm glad to see
you. Come, take something to drink. What'll you have? and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>that chap
there with you, what'll you have, my beauty?"</p>

<p>This coarse language grated a good deal on Samuel's ears, and it was
by no means pleasant to Frederick; but it did not affect both boys in
exactly the same way. The former was so much disgusted, that, after
thanking the butcher's boy for his invitation, he was hurrying away as
fast as possible. The latter, while he did not care a straw for the
liquor, felt kindly towards his former schoolfellow, and was rather
disposed to gratify him by at least going through the ceremony of
drinking.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>Frederick is on dangerous ground now. But he had been on dangerous
ground before, you recollect. He got off the rocks then. Let us hope
he will now. But Freddy, you must look out. As the sailor says, when
he is looking out at the mast head, and when he sees the vessel is
driving rapidly towards the surf, "breakers ahead!" There is
temptation here. To be sure, it is not so strong, but he can overcome
it. How easily he resisted a similar temptation on Thanksgiving day.
The result of that day's adventures shows that he can get along safely
enough, if he will only <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>look out for himself. But <i>will</i> he look out
for himself? We shall see.</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better walk along, Fred?" asked Samuel, in a kind and
pleasant tone of voice.</p>

<p>"Not quite yet, if you please," said Frederick.</p>

<p>"Come, say what you'll have, Fred! Take a pull at this 'ere old
Jamaky? The real critter, Fred, the real critter&mdash;none of your Boston
pisin stuff. Or what do you say to a double and twisted horn of brandy
what's jist come from France?"</p>

<p>Fred hesitated. Strange enough that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>he should hesitate. Was he
charmed, as a bird is said to be charmed by a black snake, so that he
could not move?</p>

<p>"It is time to be off, Fred. Take my advice, and come along," said
Samuel.</p>

<p>"You little chicken-hearted baby!" Peter broke in, "hold your tongue,
if you don't want it pulled out by the roots."</p>

<p>"Wait half a minute," said Frederick to his companion. "Peter, pray
don't talk so to Samuel. He is one of the best fellows that ever
lived."</p>

<p>"Well, he ain't worth minding, any how. Come, now, are you going to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>drink or not? Take some punch? That's the stuff. There ain't no spirit
in it hardly. Or may be you'll have some gin."</p>

<p>And the butcher's boy poured out a glass half full of gin and water,
and passed it to Frederick, while he took good care to prepare another
glass for himself. Peter drank. <i>So did Frederick</i>&mdash;not because he
loved the liquor, but because he was good-natured. He did it to oblige
his former school-fellow. I said he did it because he was
good-natured. I ought rather to have said, perhaps, that it was
because he had not <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>courage enough to do right. I am not sure but that
is a more correct reason than the other.</p>

<p>Poor Frederick! From the moment he drank that glass of gin, he felt
unhappy. All day long he thought of what he had done, and it robbed
him of all his peace.</p>

<p>"But never mind, Fred," said his companion, "you are sorry you did it,
and you will never drink any more. Let that comfort you."</p>

<p>I will drop the thread of Frederick's history here, for the present.
Perhaps I may take it up again, though, by and by. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>The reason I have
given any sketch at all of this boy's adventures, I frankly confess
it, is that by comparing him with Samuel, and noticing where he
stumbled, and how he stumbled, you might learn exactly what those
traits of character were by which the latter was able to get over the
difficulties he met with, and to resist the temptations that
surrounded him.</p>

<h3>CHAP. XI.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>LIFE IN A FACTORY.</h4>
<br />

<p>Have you ever been inside of a cotton factory, reader? If so, you need
not be told what sort of a place it is. I remember very well how I
felt the first time I went into a spinning room. What a whirl of
little wheels and great wheels, of bobbins and spindles, of drums and
cylinders, there was in that room. My brain seemed to go round with
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>wheels; and I could hardly help holding my head with both hands,
to keep it in its place. What a clatter was kept up by some of the
machinery. What a dull, droning, hum-drum sound there was, besides. I
could not hear the sound of my own voice, there was such a racket; and
such a dense fog settled upon my mind, on account of the noise, that I
could scarcely tell whether I was in the body or out of the body. Of
all the places in the world, that ever I had seen or heard of, or ever
expected to see or hear of, I firmly believed that the worst place for
a boy to live, day after <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>day, was in the spinning room of a cotton
factory. I had heard of dismal dungeons, in which the light of day
never shone; and I had thought that they were bad enough. But this
factory seemed a great deal worse than any dungeon that was ever
invented. The factory would drive me crazy in a week. I was sure of
that. In the dungeon, on the other hand, which, though it might be as
dark as tar, was still and quiet, I fancied I could at least keep my
senses.</p>

<p>A factory is a busy place, too. It is one of the last situations in
the world <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>where a lazy person would wish to be employed. You can't be
lazy there, if you try. A horse might as well undertake to be lazy in
a treadmill. Some people think that factory boys and factory girls
have to work <i>too</i> hard; that they are confined too many hours a day,
and that they don't get fresh air enough. As to that, I shall not set
myself up for a judge. Very likely the children fare better in some
factories than they do in others. I will say, though, that the task of
a factory boy, were the factory ever so well managed, would not be so
pleasant to me as many others. I will say <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>this; and I ought to say,
besides, that when a boy gets <i>used</i> to the noise of a factory, he
does not mind it much. Though it almost deafens him at first, he
almost forgets there is any noise after a while.</p>

<p>Our young friend, the peddler's boy, made up his mind, the first day
he went to work in Mr. Mason's factory, that he <i>would</i> like the
business, whether or no. Well, he did like it, after a week or
two&mdash;that is, he was content with it, and he was as cheerful and happy
in the factory as he had been out of it. Contentment, my dear young
friends, is a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>gem. It is worth more than gold or diamonds. You can't
buy it with gold or diamonds, and if you should ever happen to get
hold of it, you would be foolish to part with it, for all the gold in
California and all the pearls in the tower of London. I have often
thought, that if the apostle Paul were to be envied for anything, it
might be for the contented spirit which he had, after he got to be an
old man. "I have learned," said he, "in whatsoever state I am,
therewith to be content." What a precious lesson! I wish you would try
to learn it, reader. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>You can learn it. You ought to learn it. Set
yourself about the task, then, at once.</p>

<p>Samuel Bissell was content with his factory life. It was not quite so
pleasant as some others were. He could not help seeing that. But he
did not spend his time or any part of his time in wishing he was
somewhere else, doing some other kind of business. He did not say or
sing, "There's a good time coming, boys." The good time <i>had come</i>,
according to his notion. Still, he held on to that resolution&mdash;the
resolution he formed when he got a glimpse of some of the wonders away
off in the blue sky. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>If you had watched him during the few leisure
hours he had, you would have seen that he had not forgotten that old
text of his, "I'll be somebody." Many and many a time, after he got
home from the factory at night, he would go to his little room, and
spend an hour or two reading and thinking. There was a small library
in the village where he lived, and by paying a small sum every week,
he was allowed to read some very valuable books. With what eagerness
he picked up every kernel of knowledge he could find about the sun,
and the planets, and the stars. When most of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>the boys were playing in
the streets, he was reading and studying in his chamber. While he was
a factory boy, he learned from the books which fell into his hands, to
dive a great deal deeper into the heart of many studies than he was
taught to do in the school to which his father had sent him. He had
become quite a master of the art of book-keeping; and as to geography
and astronomy, I am not sure but he could have told some things about
them which his former teacher never dreamed of.</p>

<h4>A GLANCE AT FREDERICK.</h4>
<br />

<p>Before I wind up my story, I have a good mind to go back, and tell you
what became of that companion of our friend, the Peddler's Boy, who
drank the glass of gin. Poor Frederick! It makes my heart sad, to
think what he might have been, and what he was. He was as kind, and
amiable, and industrious, and prudent, as Samuel. His habits were as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>good, too, for aught that I know, up to the time when he was so
thoughtless and foolish as to yield to the wishes of that coarse and
wicked boy. He had been as well brought up as Samuel. Good principles
had been as carefully sown in his mind. There was, then, there could
have been no general reason why he did not show himself more of a hero
when he met his old schoolmate.</p>

<p>How foolish it was for Frederick to taste that liquor. He did not love
gin. He disliked the taste of it. Moreover, he knew well enough that
it was wrong to taste it, and I presume he saw clearly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>enough, at the
time, that he was making a little dunce of himself. Why did he not run
away, if he could not resist temptation while he stayed there? Why,
when Samuel reminded him, so kindly, that it was time for them to go,
did he not go along about his business? How foolish it was for him to
stay and drink that dram, which tasted to him, I dare say, almost as
bad as a dose of salts? Oh, if he had only had more courage, more
principle! But there he failed&mdash;and his failure cost him dearly!</p>

<p>Samuel, you will recollect, tried to console him, after he had drank
the glass <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>of gin, to please Peter, by telling him that he was sure he
would never do so again. But Samuel, it appeared afterwards, was too
hopeful, too charitable. Frederick did drink again. How long it was
after that holiday, before he did so, I don't know. Nor is it much
matter. It is sufficient to know, that when a like temptation was
placed before him again, he had less power to resist it than he had
before. He drank again, and it was not many months before he liked
dram-drinking as well as any of the boys in the factory.</p>

<p>However, Frederick had friends in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>city; and when he was about
twenty-one years of age, some of these friends got him a good place as
a clerk in a wholesale grocery store. He seemed to "turn over a new
leaf," when he went to Boston to live. If he drank any&mdash;and I suppose
he did a little&mdash;his habit did not grow much stronger, and he was a
very faithful clerk.</p>

<p>After a year or two, he did so well, that his friends loaned him
money, and he went into business for himself. For a year or two he did
well, and was prosperous. His credit was good. His business increased.
There was no <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>reason why he should not continue to prosper. None, did
I say? There was one. His love for dram-drinking grew stronger, after
a while, and he drank more and more. Not that he ever got absolutely
drunk; but it was not an uncommon thing for him to get <i>high</i>, as they
sometimes say of the first stages of drunkenness&mdash;so high that he
talked and acted very like a fool.</p>

<p>A habit of this kind is apt to grow upon a person. It grew upon
Frederick. I will not trace his path, through all its windings, from
tasting to moderate drinking, from moderate drinking to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>drunkenness,
and from drunkenness to ruin. But such was his course. He drank till
he entirely lost the power of controlling his appetite. His business
affairs got out of order, and they became worse and worse. He failed.
Not long after this, he was often seen reeling about the streets of
Boston, a poor, miserable, drunken wretch.</p>

<p>One night, when he was drunk, some one who knew him, ordered a
carriage, and took him to the neat little cottage which was the home
of his childhood. His aged parents were already aware, to some extent,
of Frederick's habits; but when they saw there, before their eyes,
that living wreck of what was once their son, it seemed as if their
hearts would break with anguish. That night they said not a word to
their son. They knew that he was not himself, and that anything he
might say then, would only add to their grief.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>The next day, however, after the reason of their miserable son had
been partly restored, they had a long talk with him. He knew to what a
depth he had fallen. But he declared, over and over again, that there
was no hope for him. "I am lost!" said he; "I am <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>lost! Father," he
continued, "I am drinking up my soul, and no power on earth can stop
me. I could no more live without liquor, than a fish can live out of
water. I am on fire, and nothing will help to quench the flames, but
the liquor which feeds them."</p>

<p>Then he told the old man the story of that first glass of gin. "It was
that," said he, "which has done all the mischief. If I had not played
the fool then, I might have been somebody now. But I yielded to
temptation. I formed the taste for liquor. It has grown upon me, until
I am the loathsome beast that you <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>see before you. No, I never can
stop drinking until I die."</p>

<p>Poor, poor man! in less than three weeks after this interview with his
parents, he died&mdash;died of that most terrible disease, the delirium
tremens.</p>

<p>My young friends, before I leave this story of Frederick, let me urge
you to beware of the first glass. I don't care whether it is gin, or
rum, or brandy. Don't touch it. If you are tempted to drink, be a
hero. Have courage to say "No, I'll not throw myself away. I think too
much of myself for that."</p>

<h4>SAMUEL IN BOSTON.</h4>
<br />

<p>Time wore away. The peddler's boy, when he made up his mind to go to
work in the factory, did not expect to spend his days there. He
purposed to enter the factory because he thought that that was the
best thing he could do <i>then</i>. You will recollect that he said to his
father, when the old gentleman asked him what he would like to do,
that there <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>were a great many things which he should <i>like</i> to do, and
that may be he would do them some day; but that as he could not do
them <i>then</i>, he thought he would go to work in the factory, and wait
until he could do them. Samuel, at length, began to think that it was
time for him to look for some other business a little more to his mind
than what he was doing then. So thought the good old peddler, his
father. His mother&mdash;alas! she had gone to her rest&mdash;her smiling face
had long been missed in the little cottage where she had dwelt so many
years. It was decided that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>Samuel should go to Boston. But what was
he to do there? That question gave others more anxiety than it gave
Samuel. "I don't know, to be sure," said he, "exactly what I'll find
to do. But I know I'll do <i>something</i>. I'll shovel dirt, if I can't
get anything else to do, and I can make a living at that."</p>

<p>He went to Boston. The first thing he did, after he got there, was to
walk straight to the house of Captain Lovechild. The captain was at
home, and glad to see him.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," the boy asked, "when you came to our house, a
great <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>while ago, and brought your telescope with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the old man replied, "and I remember, too, how a certain little
fellow got almost crazy when he looked through the instrument, at the
moon and stars, and when I told him something about them."</p>

<p>"And do you remember <i>what</i> you said?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm sure I don't."</p>

<p>"Well, I do, as plainly as if you had said it but yesterday; and it
was what you said about living to some purpose, and having a high aim,
and being <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>governed by high principles, that put a new soul into me."</p>

<p>"And made you talk so largely?"</p>

<p>Samuel colored. "I was a foolish little creature, I suppose," he said.</p>

<p>"No, not a bit of it," said the captain, grasping the young man's
hand, "not a bit of it. I was glad to hear you say what you did. I've
thought of it a thousand times since, and I have said to myself, 'That
chap will make something, if he lives, see if he don't.'"</p>

<p>"Well, he <i>hasn't</i> made anything yet."</p>

<p>The captain laughed. "I don't quite agree with you," he said. "But,
let <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>that be as it may, you are young yet, and the great pyramid and
St. Peter's church were not built in a minute. Sam, what are you now?"</p>

<p>"A poor, green factory boy."</p>

<p>"Who is trying to do his duty, and sometimes asks God to help him; who
is wide awake and ambitious; who has got a pretty good head and not a
very bad heart; who will push his way in the world and be somebody?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about all that."</p>

<p>"Nor I, but I know some things about you&mdash;more than you dream of, I
guess."</p>

<p>Samuel colored again, and tried to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>stammer out something, but
succeeded only tolerably well.</p>

<p>"You want something to do, don't you?" the old man asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the peddler's boy, "that is what I came to Boston
for."</p>

<p>"Well, let me think a moment," said the good old gentleman. He did
think a moment, and then he put on his hat, and got the gold-headed
cane which he cut on the island of Malta, where Paul was cast away,
and off he posted with his young friend. He knew what he was about. He
had not been thinking for nothing. After walking some ten or <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>fifteen
minutes, he went into a store on Commercial wharf, and asked one of
the partners of the house, whom he seemed to know very well, if they
did not want a clerk. The answer was that they did not need another
clerk, but that they were very much in want of a good porter.</p>

<p>"Well, here's the chap," said the captain, pointing to Samuel. "Sam,
what do you say to that?"</p>

<p>Samuel was inclined to try the business, and in less than half an
hour, the terms were arranged, and the young lad was at work.</p>

<h3>CHAP. XIV.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>THE FLOUR STORE.</h4>
<br />

<p>The men with whom Samuel had found a place, were large flour dealers.
Their new porter pleased them. He, too, was pleased with his business.
Nothing could be more pleasant for me now, than to relate to you
scores of little incidents connected with Samuel's history, while he
was in that store. But if I do that, I fear I shall spin out my thread
so <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>long that you will get weary. I will tell you a few things,
though.</p>

<p>It was Samuel's daily duty to sweep out the store. This task he
performed early in the morning, before either of the partners or any
of the clerks were at their posts. One morning, the first thing he
saw, after opening the store, was a roll of bank bills, lying on the
floor. He took it up, and unrolled it. There were some ten or twelve
dollars in it. As soon as the book-keeper came to the store, Samuel
handed him the roll of bank bills, and went about his work. That was a
small matter, wasn't it? <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>But small as it was, those flour merchants,
when they heard of it, noted it down in their memory.</p>

<p>Months passed. The book-keeper went into business for himself. A new
book-keeper was needed to take his place. Samuel was talked of. "But
can Samuel be depended upon?" it was asked. "Can we trust him? Is he
faithful, and honest, and capable?" I don't know what decision they
would have come to, if it had not been for the affair of the bank
bills. But his honesty in that particular was brought up. They thought
it would do to trust a young man <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>who could resist such a temptation
as that. There was another thing they had heard about Samuel, which
they thought pretty good evidence that he was honest. It was this:
While Samuel was in the factory, he bought some articles at the
village store. After he had paid for them, and got away a little
distance, he found that the clerk had made a mistake in giving change,
and that he had in his pocket fifty cents more than belonged to him.
So he turned right around, went back to the store, and returned the
money to the clerk.</p>

<p>"He's the man," they all said, as soon <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>as these facts were stated. So
Samuel became the book-keeper in that large house, with a salary four
times as large as he had received while he was the porter.</p>

<p>Some two or three years from the time he went to Boston to live,
Samuel Bissell was one of the partners in that wealthy firm. He is by
no means an old man now. Indeed, he is in the very prime of life. But
he has got to be a rich man, and now owns one of the most beautiful
country seats within a dozen miles of Boston, where he resides with
his family. A great many merchants are so much <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>engaged in making
money, that they seem to care hardly anything about improving the
mind, and so they let that get all full of weeds. But Mr. Bissell did
very differently. He spent a great part of the time which he could
spare from his business, in gathering new sheaves of knowledge, and
cultivating the garden of the heart.</p>

<p>I hardly know of a man for miles around, in that charming district of
country, who is more respected and beloved than Samuel Bissell. When I
saw him last, he had just been elected the second time to a seat in
the legislature <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>of the State. I think he is a member of the Senate
now.</p>

<p>I wish you could visit his place in the country, and see his fine
garden and fine house. If you ever should happen that way, and should
learn where he lives, you must not fail to make him a visit, and to
tell him that Uncle Frank asked you to call. You will see there one of
the happiest families that you ever came across in your life. Mr.
Bissell sometimes amuses his children with stories about his boyhood,
and they are perfectly delighted with these stories.</p>

<div class="img"><a name="imagep147" id="imagep147"></a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span><br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>

<p class="cen" style="margin-top: .2em;">MR. BISSELL AND HIS CHILDREN.<span class="totoi"><a href="#toi">ToList</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>Don't forget to inquire for the good <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>old peddler, as soon as you
get into the house. "What! is he living yet?" To be sure he is, and
Samuel has fitted up for him one of the pleasantest rooms in the whole
house. His hair is very white, and he was very feeble when I saw him
last. But his heart was as young as ever; and he laughed, and played,
and frolicked with his grandchildren just as merrily as if he had been
a child himself.</p>

<p>Another thing I must tell you, while I think of it. There is a cupola
on the top of Samuel's house, and I want you should go into that, if
you can get a chance. There you will see quite a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>number of things
which are worth seeing. One of them, perhaps, when you come to know
what it is, will interest you more than all the rest. It is the very
telescope which used to belong to Captain Lovechild, and which made
Samuel's heart throb so, when he was a child&mdash;"put a new soul" into
him, to use his own language. The old gentleman, some time since, left
this world, I trust for a better and a happier one. Just before he
died, he made a will, in which he remembered many of his friends, and
Samuel, among the rest, to whom he gave the old telescope. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>Mr.
Bissell has more than once been heard to say, that he would not part
with that telescope for a good farm.</p>

<h4>THE WINDING UP.</h4>
<br />

<p>If I should undertake to tell my readers what lessons this story
teaches, I am not sure but they would laugh at me. I fancy I see their
bright eyes twinkle, as I begin to talk about these lessons, and I
almost hear them say to one another, that Uncle Frank might as well
carry a lantern in broad daylight, as to spend his time in telling us
what this story <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>teaches. Some of them wonder, perhaps, if Uncle Frank
really takes his readers for a set of little dunces.</p>

<p>Well, then, my shrewd little boy, what does the story teach?</p>

<p>"Why it teaches that the Peddler's Boy set out to be somebody, and he
was somebody."</p>

<p>Very well. Anything else, little girl? I must catechise you a little.
What do you learn from it?</p>

<p>"That anybody can do anything he sets out to do, and that he can be
anything he sets out to be."</p>

<p>Bravo! that is pretty well, only a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>little too strong. And what else?
Why didn't Frederick get along in the world as well as Samuel?</p>

<p>"Because he was a coward."</p>

<p>I'm not sure but you are half right. It seems hard to call that poor,
unfortunate youth a coward. But I do honestly think that he would have
done well enough, if he had only scraped together a few more grains of
courage. Look at that affair of the glass of gin. It was courage that
he wanted there&mdash;courage to do right, no matter what his old playmate
might say or think. He was afraid to offend the boy. He had more fear
of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>the boy, it would appear, than he had of God. What that coarse,
profane boy said, had more weight with him than the words which his
conscience uttered. It was <i>principle</i>, after all, that he lacked. And
so he was led away, and lost.</p>

<p>"Uncle Frank, I shall never forget what one glass will do."</p>

<p>I hope you never will; and I hope you will remember, too, as long as
you live, that the success of the Peddler's Boy was owing quite as
much to his honesty, and temperance, and faithfulness, and
religion&mdash;for he was a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>sincere and devoted Christian&mdash;as to his
ambition, and industry, and energy, and resolution.</p>
